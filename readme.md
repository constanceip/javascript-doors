1. Create a website/program that allows a user to enter information into a `prompt()`. The program will ask the user what door they'd like to choose. When the door information is entered, show the user feedback on the screen as to what is behind the door. Use an array to store the different values that could be behind the door.

2. Submit a fixed version of this script:



FIXED: 

function sayHelicopterName(name) {
console.log(name);
}

var helicopter = "Sikorsky";
sayHelicopterName(helicopter);

var helicopters = ["Apache", "Cobra", "Harbin Z-19", "Kamov Ka-50"];

for(x = 0; x < helicopters.length; x++){
	sayHelicopterName(helicopters[x]);
}
